# independence_day_tech
Today, I celebrated our nation’s pride in a techy way — by drawing the Indian National Flag using Python’s sketchpy library. 🖥️✨It’s a reminder that technology can be not just functional, but also expressive and creative. 💡💻  Wishing everyone a day filled with freedom, unity, and innovation. Jai Hind!
